Credit Report Summary Analysis Dashboard - Power BI

I recently developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze credit report performance across different banks with a strong focus on Year-over-Year (YoY) growth and performance insights.

Dashboard Features:

1. Top 3 Growing & Declining Banks (YoY Growth)

2. Monthly & Yearly Bank Slicers for dynamic filtering

3. Credit Report Count & Average per Month

4. Highest Performing Bank (over 4 years)

5. Lowest Performing Bank (over 4 years)

6. Credit Report Trends across years & months

7. Max Count Card - highlights the month, year, and bank with the highest credit reports

8. Min Count Card - shows the lowest performance period

This dashboard provides deep insights into banking performance trends, making it easier for stakeholders to identify growth opportunities, risks, and overall credit dynamics.
